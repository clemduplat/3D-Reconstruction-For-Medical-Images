This repository implements 3D reconstruction techniques for radiographic and angiographic imaging. Methods include Direct Linear Transform (DLT) calibration, epipolar constraints, and error analysis in digital imaging.

LAB 1: Calibration of a radiographic system

LAB2: 3D Reconstruction of Coronary Arteries by Angiography

Final Project: Efficient segmentation of 3D MRI brain tumor using various U-Net architectures
